# CamemeBert-Natural-language-processing
This natural language processing and deep learning project aims to process customer feedback and complaints following a satisfaction survey that customers complete after receiving a service or purchasing a product.
This model can be used in combination with a satisfaction survey, sociological or scientific study surveys where feedback is provided in text format. This “CamemBert” version processes text in French, but there are other models for English (Bert) or multilingual texts, which can be found on Hugging Face.
The model is trained using the GPU of Google Colab Notebook, since it is a model with many parameters and requires significant computing resources. With a local CPU on your machine, training takes a very long time and you will need a GPU or training on Google's Vertex AI cloud, for example.
One of the problems to consider is data imbalance, which causes overfitting on minority classes. In my case, I chose to randomly select 1,000 comments from each label with comments not exceeding 512 words. This choice was made to balance the dataset somewhat and not lose meaning and context by taking comments that exceed the encoding capacity of the model. I chose not to process and clean the text thanks to Camembert's tokenization, which processes the text in such a way that even noise in the text does not influence the context.
